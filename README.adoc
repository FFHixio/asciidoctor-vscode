== How to Install

Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter:

`ext install joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode`

Alternatively you can use the built-in extension browser to find the _AsciiDoc_ by _joaompinto_ extension and install it.

== How to Use

The extension activates automatically when opening an AsciiDoc file (.adoc, ad, .asc, .asciidoc).

=== Preview

To show the preview you can use the same commands as the Markdown extension:

* Toggle Preview - `ctrl+shift+v` (Mac: `cmd+shift+v`)
* Open Preview to the Side - `ctrl+k v` (Mac: `cmd+k v`)

The preview refreshes automatically, but it can also be forced with the _AsciiDoc: Refresh Preview_ command.

By default the preview style follows the VSCode theme (`workbench.colorTheme`). To use Asciidoctor's style set option `asciidoc.preview.useEditorStyle` to `false`. +
(See more details under <<#_options,Options>>)

=== Export as PDF

The extension provides a quick command to export your AsciiDoc file as PDF.

. Open the command palette - `ctrl+shift+p` or `F1` (Mac: `cmd+shift+p`)
. Select _AsciiDoc: Export document as PDF_
. Choose the folder and filename for the generated PDF

By default a separate binary is downloaded and used to render the document in PDF format. To use Asciidoctor PDF set option `asciidoc.use_asciidoctorpdf` to `true`. +
(See more details under <<#_options,Options>>)

=== Snippets

Several code snippets are provided including but not limited to: include statements, images, links, header, headings, lists, blocks, etc...

For a full list open the command palette and select _Insert Snippet_.
